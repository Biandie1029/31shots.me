                        <p>
                            31 has always been intrigued by the idea of photography but he never took the opportunity to explore himself artistically and puruse it as a career. Throughout his college journey, 31 has been blessed with the opportunity to be part of a new student organization at the Unviversity of Miami called the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/thelab.miami?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet&igsh=ZDNlZDc0MzIxNw==">Lab Miami</a>. The Lab is a space on campus for students who are interested in photography, videography, editing and/or event coverage. Through the Lab, 31 was able to create a career shooting various student-led events on campus. After a semester of shooting, he is now expanding his interests and beginning to pursue cinematography and documentary style film.
