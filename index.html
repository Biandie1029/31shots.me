                                <p>
                                    31 has always been intrigued by the idea of photography but never took the opportunity to discover himself artistically and pursue it as a career. Through his college journey, he has been blessed with the opportunity to be part of a new student organization at the Unviversity of Miami called the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/thelab.miami?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet&igsh=ZDNlZDc0MzIxNw==">Lab Miami</a>. The Lab is a space on campus for students who are interested in photography, videography, editing and/or event coverage. Through the Lab, 31 was able to create a career shooting student events on campus just after one semester of shooting and is now beginning to explore cinematography and documentary style film.

                                    31 is a firm believer in following his dreams, and while venturing into the unknown, he knows that by continuing to uplift the voices of the African American community and advocating for the causes he believes in, his photos and films will make a difference all over the world.
