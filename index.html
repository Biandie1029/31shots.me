            <h2>How it all Started</h2>
            <article>
                <p>Since childhood, 31 has always been intrigued by the idea of photography but he never took the opportunity to explore himself artistically and puruse it as a career. Throughout his collegiate career, 31 has been blessed to find himself part of a new student organization at the Unviversity of Miami called the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/thelab.miami?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet&igsh=ZDNlZDc0MzIxNw==">Lab Miami</a>. The Lab is a space on campus for students who are interested in photography, videography, editing as well as everything that geos into production and/or event coverage. Through the Lab, 31 was able to create a career shooting various student-led events on campus. After a semester of shooting, he is now expanding his interests and beginning to pursue cinematography through production, event coverage and documentary style film. Without the Lab, 31 would not be where he is today so he makes sure to honor is Co-Presidents Jasmine <a href="https://www.instagram.com/j.a.z._._?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet&igsh=ZDNlZDc0MzIxNw==">"Jaz"</a> Danielle Sawyer and Zuri <a href="https://www.instagram.com/i_am_zee3?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet&igsh=ZDNlZDc0MzIxNw==">"ZG"</a> Greenlee, without these two, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/_31shots_?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet&igsh=ZDNlZDc0MzIxNw==">@_31shots_</a> woudl not be the page it is today.</p>
