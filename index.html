        <p>
        Hello! Welcome to my first webpage. My name is B and I am a computer science major at the University 
        of Miami. The webpage you are viewing right now is a result of my web design class. I have always 
        wanted to make my own website, so taking this class has been the highlight of my semester so far.  
        </p>

        <h2>
            The Purpose of this Website
        </h2>

        <p>
        This website currently serves as a portfolio of all my photography. After this semester it will 
        be a fully functional site where my clients will be able to buy my products, and book me for photoshoots. 
        Be sure to check back in for updates on my journey, displays of my latest projects and all my acheivements
        in between. Thank you for visiting. I hope you enjoy! 
        </p>

        <h2>
            What I Hope to See
        </h2>

        <p>
        I want my website to be one where users feel safe and encouraged to purchase products. I want my 
        website to be accessible to everyone so that anyone who may need my photography has the opportunity to receive. 
        I want this website to be efficient and neatly organized so that my users have the best experience 
        without getting frustrated at any point in the process.
        </p>
