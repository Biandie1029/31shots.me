            <h2>How it Started</h2>
                <p>
                    Since childhood, 31 has always been intrigued by the idea of photography but he never took the opportunity to explore himself artistically and puruse it as a career. Throughout his collegiate career, 31 has been blessed to find himself part of a new student organization at the Unviversity of Miami called the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/thelab.miami?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet&igsh=ZDNlZDc0MzIxNw==">Lab Miami</a>. The Lab is a space on campus for students who are interested in photography, videography, editing as well as everything that geos into production and/or event coverage. Through the Lab, 31 was able to create a career shooting various student-led events on campus. After a semester of shooting, he is now expanding his interests and beginning to pursue cinematography through production, event coverage and documentary style film. Without the Lab, 31 would not be where he is today so he makes sure to honor is Co-Presidents Jasmine <a href="https://www.instagram.com/j.a.z._._?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet&igsh=ZDNlZDc0MzIxNw==">"Jaz"</a> Danielle Sawyer and Zuri <a href="https://www.instagram.com/i_am_zee3?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet&igsh=ZDNlZDc0MzIxNw==">"ZG"</a> Greenlee, without these two, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/_31shots_?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet&igsh=ZDNlZDc0MzIxNw==">@_31shots_</a> would not be the page it is today.

                <p>
                    Now expanding from photography, 31 plans to begin his journey into cinematography with no real direction. He is a firm beleiver in following his heart and discovering his destiny along the way. Despite venturing into the unknown, 31 knows that so long as he is continuing to amplify the voices of the African American community and advocating for the causes he believes his films and photos will continue to make a difference all over the world.
