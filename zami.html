This moment is followed by Audre asking her mom about being spit on and her mom decides to lie to her in order to keep hiding the nature of society at the time. Here, Audre’s mother further teaches her children the need of a Black woman to be \"strong\" in order to survive in a society where the odds are stacked against them in two different ways. On pages 16–17, Lorde reflects on the role of her mother as a cultural guide and enforcer of traditional gender roles. Lorde’s mother embodies strength and teaches her cultural values, influencing Lorde’s understanding of womanhood and heritage. In contrast, on page 67, Lorde writes, \"My fondest and closest memories...of warm moments shared with my father. There were not many.\" This statement underscores the distant, provider role often ascribed to men, reinforcing traditional gender norms within the diaspora. These moments show how gender roles, passed down generationally, shape Lorde’s upbringing and connection to her culture.";

Here the independence of a Black woman as it relates to pioneering their own freedom of self expression overlaps with Lorde’s journey in navigating her sexuality. She has the instinct to do things alone, because of the Black woman that came before her. Therefore, she is able to reapply that same mentality to her exploration of queerness.
