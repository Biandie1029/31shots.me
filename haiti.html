                <h1>Introduction</h1>
                <p>
                In the early 1700s, Spain agreed to share a portion of the island Hispaniola with the French. This portion of the island, now known as Haiti, became one of the most profitable parts of the Carribean at the time. However this financial success was made possible only by the labor of Africans who were enslaved on the island. Nearly 200 years later, a man by the name of Toussaint L'Ouverture led those slaves in a revolution that resulted in Haiti becoming the first independent black republic in the world.

                Fun Fact: The name Haiti (or Repiblik de Ayiti) meaning "Land of the High Mountains" was originally the name of the entire island of Hispaniola.
